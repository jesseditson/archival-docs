In the last 10 years, the web has come a long way. Browsers have standardized on HTML5 features, and they do things that we only dreamed of (or built with plugins) in the 2000s. CSS and Javascript have become rich languages and for better or worse, [pretty much everyone uses one of 2 browsers](https://gs.statcounter.com), both of which have [excellent spec support](https://caniuse.com/?compare=chrome+95,safari+15&compareCats=all).

And yet, building a website is in many ways harder than it ever has been. We have complex toolchains for cross-compiling js and css from non-standard languages like JSX and Sass, and even simple blogs require rich knowledge of webpack or other build tools just to push to a simple static host.

Sadly, these "[omakase](https://dhh.dk/2012/rails-is-omakase.html)" tools also homogenize the web. We normalize on tools that limit the creativity of the person building a website by standardizing on information architecture that isn't always the right solution for the problem. The web of the 90s and 2000s was a vibrant, if ugly at times, mash-up of creativity and exploration. We've improved in many areas like accessibility and usability, but could stand to bring creativity back to the web now that we have a solid foundation.

The world of hosting and infrastructure is also fraught. Despite the capabilities of these rich build tools, we often use servers and databases instead of generating static content. If a blog only ever changes when you change the posts, why do you need a server that has a connection to a relational store, that runs a query when a user requests it, and that has a money and energy cost similar to a social network?

Finally, despite the fact that versioning tools like git are common for code, websites are becoming more and more ephemeral and it's not yet common to store historical versions of content. We write directly to DBs, and the prior content is lost forever. We're also pushing tons of content into walled gardens like Facebook or Medium, platforms that don't have an incentive to keep your content durable and visible, and who use your content for surveilance and profit.
