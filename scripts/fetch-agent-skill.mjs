// Mirrors the agent contract - the skill a coding agent follows to build and
// publish an Archival site - into public/agent/, so it is served from
// https://archival.dev/agent/. Runs as `build:agent`, which must stay ahead of
// `build:site` in `npm run build`: that is the step that copies public/ into
// dist/.
//
// The canonical copy lives in archival, as a Claude Code plugin, so there is
// exactly one to keep correct. That copy is also the one a Claude Code *cloud*
// session can reach: raw.githubusercontent.com is on the default network
// allowlist and archival.dev is not. This mirror exists for humans, for agents
// that would rather read one documented URL, and so the contract is linkable
// from the docs.
